# Daniel Moreno's Portfolio.

My name is Daniel Moreno, I am originally from San Diego, California. I am an Electrical Engingeering Major at CSUF. I loved my time taking introduction to Computer Science and the skills I learned will stick with me for a long time.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
*Lab 1
  I think that lab one was one of the most pivotal labs for my development of an understanding of computer science. Lab one, while rather simple, challenged my mind with new ideas that I was unfamiliar with. Lab one also helped as I met my lab partner who helped me in my C++ journey. 

*Lab 6, Part 2
  This coding assignment holds a unique significance in my programming journey as it served as my introduction to game logic and scoring mechanisms. I was tasked with creating functions that evaluate the score of a two-card blackjack hand. This lab inspired me as it used the rules of a timeless card game and forced me into developing it into a functional and streamlined program.

*Lab 10, Part 1
  This coding lab was memorable in my programming journey, I was intrigued by the concept of prime numbers mixing with reversing digits. The task of determining whether both a number and its reverse are prime demanded a careful integration of prime-checking logic and string manipulation.
